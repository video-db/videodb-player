## üé® Well-Designed UI Components

<br>

![player-components](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c57447d3-8c01-4e3c-ac90-d51053488178)

VideoDB Player offers a well crafted UI, composed of modular components that ensure both functionality and aesthetic appeal. Let's break down the key elements:

1. Main Components:

- `VideoPlayer` : Main Video Player Component

2. Overlays:

- `SearchInsideMedia`: Allows users to search within the video content. Includes a UI interface specifically designed to show Video Results ‚ú®.
- `Chapters`: Chapters that overlays on a Video.
- `BigCenterButton`: Prominent play/pause control for easy interaction

3. Controls:

- `ProgressBar`: Visual indicator of playback progress. With integration of Video Chapter functionality.
- `PlayPauseButton`: Toggle between play and pause states
- `VolumeControlButton`: Adjust audio levels
- `SpeedControlButton`: Modify playback speed
- `CaptionToggleButton`: Toggle closed captions
- `FullscreenToggleButton`: Expand to full-screen mode

<br>
<br>

# üöÄ Quickstart

### Installation

Clone this repo or use the following command in your project's directory:

```bash
npm install @videodb/player-react
```

### Usage

Import the player component.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { VideoPlayer } from "@videodb/player-react";

function App() {
  return (
    <VideoPlayer streamUrl="https://stream.videodb.io/v3/published/manifests/12df6498-e955-4249-84b8-7568aaf72160.m3u8" />
  );
}

export default App;
```

<br>

# üßë‚Äçüíª Advanced Usage

### üß© Custom Overlays and Controls

`<VideoPlayer/>` accepts two props to add Custom UI components on top of the player:

- `overlayContent` (for overlays)
- `controlsContent` (for controls)

Child Components can access the player state by using the `useVideoPlayerContext` hook.
Checkout [Accessing State Inside Child Components of `VideoPlayer`](#-accessing-player-state-inside-child-components-of-videoplayer) Section for more details

![slots](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90276518-0a72-4be1-b293-2c6b1309c66a)

<br>

### üîß Custom Controls

To create custom controls for the VideoPlayer component, you can utilize the `controlsContent` prop. First, you'll need to disable the default controls by setting the `defaultControls` prop to `false`. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
<VideoPlayer
  streamUrl="https://example.com/video.m3u8"
  defaultControls={false}
  controlsContent={<YourCustomControls />}
/>
```

<br>

### üîß Custom Overlay

Similar to disabling the default controls, you can disable the default overlay by setting the `defaultOverlay` prop to `false` within the VideoPlayer component:

```jsx
<VideoPlayer
  streamUrl="https://example.com/video.m3u8"
  defaultOverlay={false}
  overlayContent={<YourCustomOverlay />}
/>
```

<br>

### üîé Using `<SearchInsideMedia/>` Component

The `<SearchInsideMedia/>` component enables in-video search functionality. To use it:

1. Disable the default overlay in `<VideoPlayer>`.
2. Add the `<SearchInsideMedia/>` component in the `overlayContent` prop.
3. To get the search results from Video you can use [VideoDB](https://videodb.io).

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { VideoPlayer, SearchInsideMedia } from "@videodb/player-react";

function App() {
  const [searchContent, setSearchContent] = useState("");
  const [searchResults, setSearchResults] = useState({ hits: [] });
  const [searchResultsLoading, setSearchResultsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [showSearchResults, setShowSearchResults] = useState(false);

  const handleSearchChange = (val) => setSearchContent(val);
  const handleSearchSubmit = (val) => {
    // Fetch search results and update state
  };

  return (
    <VideoPlayer
      streamUrl="https://example.com/video.m3u8"
      defaultOverlay={false}
      overlayContent={
        <>
          <SearchInsideMedia
            searchContent={searchContent}
            searchResults={searchResults}
            searchResultsLoading={searchResultsLoading}
            showSearchResults={showSearchResults}
            onSearchChange={handleSearchChange}
            onSearchSubmit={handleSearchSubmit}
            toggleResults={setShowSearchResults}
          />
        </>
      }
    />
  );
}
```

<br>

### üßë‚Äçüíª Accessing Player State Inside Child Components of `VideoPlayer`

The player state and methods are provided through React Context. You can access them using the `useVideoPlayerContext` hook in child components of `VideoPlayer`:

```jsx
import { useVideoPlayerContext } from "@videodb/player-react/dist/context.js";

function MyCustomControl() {
  const {
    playing,
    volume,
    duration,
    time,
    togglePlay,
    setVolume,
    // ... other properties and methods
    // checkout reference for more details
  } = useVideoPlayerContext();
  // Use these in your component
}
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Checkout [VideoPlayer interface](#videoplayer) for more details

<br>

### üßë‚Äçüíª Accessing Player Instance

Internal player instance methods and state are exposed through the context. If you need to access the player instance directly, you can use a `ref` to the `VideoPlayer` component, but most control is via context.

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import { VideoPlayer } from "@videodb/player-react";

function App() {
  const playerRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <VideoPlayer ref={playerRef} streamUrl="https://example.com/video.m3u8" />
  );
}
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Checkout [VideoPlayer interface](#videoplayer) for more details

<br>

### üîî Events

The player emits several events that you can listen to via props:

1. `onPlay`: Called when the video starts playing.
2. `onPause`: Called when the video is paused.
   > ‚ÑπÔ∏è Checkout [VideoPlayer interface](#videoplayer) for full list of events

Example usage:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { VideoPlayer } from "@videodb/player-react";

function App() {
  const handlePlay = () => {
    console.log("Video started playing");
  };

  const handlePause = () => {
    console.log("Video paused");
  };

  return (
    <VideoPlayer
      streamUrl="https://example.com/video.m3u8"
      onPlay={handlePlay}
      onPause={handlePause}
    />
  );
}
```
